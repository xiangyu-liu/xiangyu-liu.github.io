I am a fouth-year PhD student in computer science at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://www.cs.umd.edu) since 2021, working with [Prof. Kaiqing Zhang](https://kzhang66.github.io/index.html). I am also priviledged to have worked with [Prof. Furong Huang](https://furong-huang.com). Before that, I did my undergraduate in computer science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) from 2017 to 2021, doing my thesis work with [Prof. Ying Wen](https://yingwen.io).

My research is centered on principled aspects of ***reinforcement learning (RL)***, with a particular focus on the ***game-theoretical/multi-agent*** problems and ***partially observable*** problems, as well as their applications for ***(empirical) adversarially robust RL***. 

Recently, I have also extended my focus to understanding ***large language models (LLM) agents interactions*** building on the tools of ***game theory*** and ***online learning***.
