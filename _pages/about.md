I am a fouth-year PhD student in computer science at University of Maryland, College Park since 2021, working with Prof. Kaiqing Zhang. Before that, I did my undergraduate in computer science at Shanghai Jiao Tong (SJTU) University from 2017 to 2021.

My research is centered on principled aspects of reinforcement learning (RL), with a particular focus on the game-theoretical/multi-agent problems and partially observable problems, as well as their applications for (empirical) robust RL. 

Recently, I have also extended my focus to understanding large language models (LLM) agent"s" interactions building on the tools of game theory and online learning.
